# cameraide
Blender extension for extended output properties per camera object

## Overview
When your projects are too big for simple render settings but too small for complex render managers, or if you're too lazy to change settings manually over and over again. Main camera specific settings pretty much self explanatory.
## Features
- Resolution
- Swap Resolution
- Frame Range
- Frame Range Sync
- File Ouput Settings
## Usage
Generally, when you want to "save" multiple different renders from one file without manualy renaming output filename and setting resolution each time you are re-rendering.
It is also a good for "saving" frame ranges if you because I feel like when you are rendering playbalsts out you keep changing fram ranges all the time.
