## üéØ Purpose
Cameraide is designed to streamline workflow for artists who create multiple renders and playblasts during their work process. It's particularly valuable when:
- Multiple renders need to be compared and re-rendered
- Quick, good-quality results are needed fast
- Different cameras need different settings for previz and animatics

Note: Cameraide is not intended as a replacement for final render settings and setups, but rather as a rapid iteration tool for development and preview stages.
